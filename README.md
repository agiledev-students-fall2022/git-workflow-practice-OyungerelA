## Future of web will need a different sort of software developer
### Thoughts

The [article](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-future-of-the-web-will-need-a-different-sort-of-software-developer/) I read made an interesting point about how the future of software developers will have to change with the advancement of Web3 and the metaverse. It highlighted that automation and low/no code technologies will help to clear away the laborious and repetitive coding tasks that developers have to do and by doing so, provide them with more time to focus on innovation and the core business. Although it sounds plausible, I think that it is at least some years away that the so-called "boring" and "non-innovative" tasks of developers – like writing and running tests – will be fully taken care of by automation with the help of machine learning and technologies alike. However, once such technology is built, then it is with no doubt that developers will more impactfuly drive innovation forward.

Overall, I found the article very fruitful and thought-provoking. As Web3 develops and becomes the norm, the work of software developers will certainly have to adjust to the changing digital environment, for better or for worse. Until then, we will have to keep up with current trends and technologies and learn to skillfully and quickly adapt to new environments rather than focusing solely on one tech stack.
